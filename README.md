# Exception Files

## Due: Thur 1/12 at 11:59 PM

- Create a program called `ExceptionFiles.java`
- Prompt the user for a filename until the user enters the name of a file that exists
- Read in all the lines and store them in an ArrayList of integers
  - If there is any value that is not an integer, skip it and print out the value that was skipped
-  Calculate the mean (formatted to 3 decimal places), median (formatted to one decimal place), max, and min
   -  Write those values to a file called `output.txt`
